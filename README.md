### Well hello there :D 
   
I'm Luc Salvon, a computer science student at Sorbonne Université, in France.  
I'm currently in the last year of my master's degree entitled DAC (Données, Apprentissage, Connaissances / Data, Machine Learning, Knowledge).

I have a few of my projects listed here, feel free to check them out if you want :D
