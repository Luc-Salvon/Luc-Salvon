### Well hello there :D 
   
I'm Luc Salvon, a computer science student at Sorbonne Université, in France. I'm not really active here yet but I guess more will come with time :p

### Preferred languages: *The ones I'm most comfortable in*

- Python  ★★★
- Java       ★★☆
- C++       ★☆☆

*Let's pretend the stars line up... didn't put markdown in the list for a reason*

---

### I'm trying to learn ... *(I promise I'm learning them :eyes:)*

- Rust
- JavaScript

---

### Miscellaneous stuff to fill the void in our hearts with

- I'm 21 (when you're reading this the info is surely expired)
- I grew up in Burgundy in the deepness of the French countryside, so I know a few cows I guess :cow:
- I really like indie games (like I'll probably do some in the future but it's hard so let's get rich before that)
- I barely have time to play some though *(does anyone on this planet have enough time to do stuff though)*
- I also like penguins since I'm like 10, guess Tux and I were meant to be together :penguin: *don't tell him I'm also using MacOS though*
- I really don't know what to put here, so I'll start talking in toki pona because it's cool and it makes me seem inteligent:
- mi ken toki lili taso e toki pona la mi ken ala toki mute. sina ken kama sona e toki mi la sina jan pona. kijetesantakalu wawa li lon.

Anyway thanks for losing your time reading this, I hope you're having a great day.   
This is where I'd say something like "see ya!" but I probably don't know you...   
Oh well I might meet you someday so see ya!! :p
